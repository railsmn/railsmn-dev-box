# What is a gitignore file?
#
# A .gitignore file tells git what to NOT verson control. Thus, whatever files
# or folders are listed here will not be added to your git repository when you 
# use the git add command. For example, if you run this in your terminal, 
# 
#   git add open_camp
#
# will not be added to this git respository.
#


# ignore all files
*


# do not ignore these files/folders, IE they should be in git.
